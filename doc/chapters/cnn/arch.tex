\section{Testing of other CNN architectures}\label{sec:cnnarch}

I've tested other architectures, by trying to change:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The size of the filters in each convolutional layer, even by
		using different sizes for different layers.
	\item The size of the pooling layers (different sizes for different
		layers).
	\item The stride of the last pooling layers.
\end{itemize}

This has been done using the CNN definitions from 33 to 35. None of them have
outperfomed the CNN architecture defined in \secref{sec:cnnfilters}.
