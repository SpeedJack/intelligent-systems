\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:intro}

The aim of the project is to design and develop different intelligent systems
that take as input some PPG signals collected from 22 subjects while they were
performing different activities (sit, walk and run).

This chapter describes the organization of the project's MATLAB source code, in
order to allow the reader to easily navigate through the code and understand
the structure of the project.
