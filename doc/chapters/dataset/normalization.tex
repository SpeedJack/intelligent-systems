\section{Features normalization}\label{sec:normalization}

Usually, the features given as input to a neural network are normalized using a
pre-processing step already implemented by MATLAB. Here, instead, I've
developed a \texttt{normalizefeatures} stage to manually normalize the features
in the range \(\interval{-1}{1}\) and I've removed the pre-processing step from
every neural network developed in this work.

The reason for this choice is that the normal pre-processing step do not
perform the correct normalization in the windowed case: I want the value \(-1\)
to map the \emph{absolute minimum} between all the values in all the windows in
which the feature is extracted. If I let the standard pre-processing step to
perform the normalization instead, since it is not aware of the overlapped
windows in which the signal is divided, I would get that \emph{each minimum
local to a window} gets the value \(-1\), which is not what I want.
