\chapter{Determining a person's activity}\label{ch:activity}

In this chapter I will discuss the design and implementation of a multi-layer
perceptron used to determine a person's activity based on the union of features
used in the two MLPs developed in \chref{ch:ecg}. This implements the
requirements for the Task 3.2 of the Project Specifications.

The network has been created using the MATLAB's \code{patternnet} (instead of
\code{fitnet} used in the previous chapter). \tableref{table:activitymappings}
shows the mappings used for the three activity classes.

\begin{table}[hbtp]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
		\toprule
		\standout{Activity} & \standout{Label} (from
		\code{extracttargets}) & \standout{Target mapping} \\
		\midrule
		Sit & 1 & 100 \\
		Walk & 2 & 010 \\
		Run & 3 & 001 \\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}

	classes.}\label{table:activitymappings}
