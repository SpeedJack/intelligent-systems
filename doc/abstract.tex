	This project has been developed for the course of \theclass{}
	(\thecourse, \theinstitute). The aim of this project is to design and
	optimize different intelligent systems (neural networks and fuzzy
	inference systems) in order to estimate or predict electrocardiogram
	(ECG) values from signals obtained via photoplethsysmography (PPG)
	sensors.
